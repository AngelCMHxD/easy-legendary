If you don't like the look of terminal interfaces, you're probably looking for [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher) or [Rare](https://github.com/Dummerle/Rare).

## Installation

### Before you start

This tool is made for **Windows 8.1 and up**, no Win7/Linux/Wine support ***at the moment!***

### Pre-requisites

Before downloading this tool you only need `Python 3.9+`, as it will auto-install and update [legendary-gl](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) for you! (You'll need to add python to the path, there is a checkbox for that at the bottom of the Python installer)

### How to run/install

#### The easy way (using pre-compiled binaries)

1. Download the latest executable available in [releases](https://github.com/angelcmhxd/easy-legendary/releases/latest)
2. Open and enjoy!

#### The complex way (compiling it by yourself)

Note: You will also need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) to install the tool this way.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Command Prompt and `cd` to the folder where you cloned it.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. At this point, you could just run `node .` or `npm run start`, and the program will run just fine. But if you'd want to, you could compile it by yourself, to an executable file. If you want to do this, follow the steps 5 and 6.
5. Run `npm run build` and wait (Ignore any warnings of dynamic requires)
6. The resulting .exe should be at `/path/to/clone/dist/easy-legendary.exe`. You just need to open it! Enjoy!
