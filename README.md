If you don't like the look of terminal interfaces, you're probably looking for [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher) or [Rare](https://github.com/Dummerle/Rare)

## Installation

### Before you start

This tool is made for **Windows 8.1 and up**, no Win7/Linux/Wine support ***at the moment!***

### Pre-requisites

Before downloading this tool you only need `Python 3.8+`, as it will auto-install and update [legendary-gl](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) for you! (You'll need to add python to the path, there is a checkbox for that in the bottom of the Python installer)
